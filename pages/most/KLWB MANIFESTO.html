    <h1>KLWB SHORT MANIFESTO</h1>
    <p>do you want to know something...? our school system is designed to fail us. they can deny it for ages but everybody knows and realizes sometime in their life that the decision to keep teacher wages poor and put twice as much money into arbitrary school sports than actual weighted classes like the art department is really something... in my personal opinion the school is really just trying to balance the happiness of everybody while maintaining order... like keeping the teahcers, parents, and students happy while not keeping any of their actual best interests at hand. students come to school to learn, and as much as deans say that game websites are a huge distraction and shouldnt be in a learning enviroment, I could say the same about christmas or pride month decorations... (this is coming from a gay person) its just sad that schools base what they do not off the best interest of the students, but the best interest of every single thing that doesnt matter. lets say a parent was mad that the <em>art department</em> had less money than the <em>cooking department,</em>instead of mindlessly compensating with the parents and adminstrators like schools usually do, they should instead stick by their choice because well, why would art supplies cost more than kitchen tools and produce? it gets even worse when race and sexuality get involved... as a gay student I could really give a damn if I was called a faggot, to me the word is second nature, but sometimes I call my friends "fag" or "faggot", and they call me it too. its a culture thing really. but lets say a teahcer heard me say this and they didnt know I was gay? they would probally be outraged! but then they find out im gay and they apologise... if the word is really an issue, then why only tolerate it if the student has relation to the word. but anyways im getting off topic, what im trying to say is schools are confusing, and they way they handle and plan things out on a daily basis is even more questionable, now where does website blocking come into all of this... personally as a student and avid user of the internet I can understand why and support they have a blocker... for porn. but when it gets to the point where your blocking articles on substance abuse that i need for a assignment, or blocking a lgbtqia+ and suicide lifeline webpage with helpful information, i just find it crazy. and they can blame it on the service itself for blocking these sites without their permission, but at the end of the day everything is really their fault... thanks for reading my article. you can email me at <em>"ohmyitsbig@outlook.com</em> thankyou!</p>
